# Company Database Connector

The mad ~~scientist~~ Product Owner now wants to pull data from a database and output it in the same dictionary format as before.

Another team is creating a `company_db` library, but it is still in development. In the meantime we can use Mocking to begin integration with the library, a stub has been created in `company_db/` for mocking purposes.

1. Our code needs to call `get_cute_animals()` to return a list of all cute animals
1. Our code needs to call `get_cute_animal(name="<name>")` to get the details of a single cute animal

The `company_db` library returns custom objects of type `CuteAnimal` with the folowing structure and a method, `.to_dict()`, to convert it to a Python dictionary

```python
class CuteAnimal:
  name: str
  age: int
  cuteness_level: int
```

To begin integrating with this unfinished library we'll have to get PyTest to return known values. Lets create a fixture for what we know the first method call will return.

*Example:*
```python
@pytest.fixture
def cute_animals_list():
    return ["Beatrice", "Bernard", "Samantha", "Steven"]
```

Now we can use `unittest`'s `mock.patch` to override calls to the library so they return our known data

```python
def test_get_cute_animals(cute_animals_list):
    # Create the get_cute_animal_names() method for testing
    with mock.patch("company_db.get_cute_animals") as mocker:
        mocker.return_value = cute_animals_list
        
        expected = cute_animals_list
        actual = get_cute_animal_names()
        assert actual == expected
```

With the first requirement ticked off, we can move onto setting up the test for the second requirement.

We can reuse the `example_dict` fixture for this test, but need a matching `CuteAnimal` object to compare against

*Example:*
```python
@pytest.fixture
def cute_animal_steven():
    return CuteAnimal(name="Steven", age=6, cuteness_level=18000)
```

Now we can override calls to the `get_cute_animal()` method to return the `CuteAnimal` object as we know that's what we should be geting

*Example:*
```python
def test_get_cute_animal(cute_animal_steven, example_dict):
    # Create the get_cute_animal_details() method for testing
    with mock.patch("company_db.get_cute_animal") as mocker:
        mocker.return_value = cute_animal_steven

        expected = example_dict
        actual = get_cute_animal_details(cute_animal_name="Steven")
        assert actual == expected
```
