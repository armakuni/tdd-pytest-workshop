# Read and Parse JSON

The Product Owner has demanded that the OmniThingyParserâ„¢ has to take in the path to a `.json` file and parse the contents, returning the data in a dictionary.

First, we want a fixture to represent some JSON data. Fixtures can help us to define static content to use during the test. 

*Example:*
```python
@pytest.fixture
def json_dict():
  return json.dumps({
    "name": "Steven",
    "age": 6,
    "cuteness_level": 18000
  })
```

Next, we'll take advantage of PyTest's inbuilt `tmp_path` fixture to manage the lifecycle of a JSON file

//This means no manual files have to be created, and the tests will run anywhere

*Example:*
```python
@pytest.fixture
def config_file(tmp_path, json_dict):
    file = tmp_path / "cute_animal.json"
    try:
        file.write_text(json_dict)
        # During the test, return the temp file
        yield str(file)
    finally:
        # On test teardown, remove the file
        file.unlink()
```

Finally, we want a test to utilise the `config_file` fixture to create a JSON file, then execute our implementation to parse the file. This is where we start writing production code.

*Example:*
```python
def test_json_parser(config_file, json_dict):
    # Create the json_parser() method for testing
    expected = json_dict
    actual = json_parser(config_file)
    assert actual == expected
```
