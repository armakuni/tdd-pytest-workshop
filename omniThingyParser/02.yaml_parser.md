# Read and Parse YAML

Now our crazy Product Owner wants the OmniThingyParserâ„¢ to take in the path to a `.yaml` file and parse the contents, returning the data in a dictionary.

First, we want some example YAML data, we've seen something like this before. With a bit of jiggery-pokery we can create a reusable fixture.

Fixtures in a `conftest.py` files are automatically loaded by pytest and are available to all tests. We can use this to hold shared fixtures, like example data

*Example:*
```python
# conftest.py
@pytest.fixture
def example_dict():
  return {
    "name": "Steven",
    "age": 6,
    "cuteness_level": 18000
  }
```

Now we can use the `example_dict` fixture as a parameter another fixture to create YAML output.

*Example:*
```python
# test_yaml_parser.py
@pytest.fixture
def example_yaml(example_dict):
    return yaml.safe_dump(example_dict)
```

Then, as before we can use the `tmp_path` fixture to manage the lifecycle of the temp file.

*Example:*
```python
@pytest.fixture
def config_file(tmp_path, example_yaml):
    file = tmp_path / "cute_things.yaml"
    try:
        file.write_text(example_yaml)
        yield str(file)
    finally:
        file.unlink()
```

Finally, our test looks pretty similar. We just need to create the `yaml_parser` method.

*Example:*
```python
def test_yaml_parser(config_file, example_dict):
    # Create the yaml_parser() method for testing
    expected = example_dict
    actual = yaml_parser(config_file)
    assert actual == expected
```
